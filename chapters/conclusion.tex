\chapter{CONCLUSION}

A new numerical web-based frequency domain tool is developed to compute hydrodynamic force 
and motions with low to moderate forward speed. The effect of forward speed was implemented by 
changing normal incident frequencies with the encounter frequencies as incident frequencies
changes as the object moves according to the Doppler effect. Also, the boundary conditions were also
changes where forward speed terms and encountering frequencies were used to define them. Thus, the 
results obtained then were compared against MDLHydroD softwares results. For comparison KCS and KVLCC2
vessels' hull structures were used. Results show good agreement with the MDLHydroD software.
Drift force are computed using the perturbation theory. All the terms of interest for drift force are 
written using a small perturbation parameter till the second degree. After, substituting these terms 
in the integral equations of force and moment. The terms corresponding to second degree of perturbation 
parameter are taken to get the second order force and moment. Comparisons of drift force is done 
between MDLHydroD and WAMIT6. Since, MDLHydroD also implements the effect of hull emergence angle, hence
the value of drift force is less for some mode of motions as compared to WAMIT6.
