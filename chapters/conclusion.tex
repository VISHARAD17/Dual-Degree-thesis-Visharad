\chapter{CONCLUSION}

A new numerical web-based frequency domain tool is developed to compute hydrodynamic force 
and motions with low to moderate forward speed. The effect of forward speed was implemented by 
chaanging normal incident frequencies with the encounter frequencies as incident frequencies
changes as the object moves according to the Doppler effect. Also, the boundary conditions were also
changes where forward speed terms and encountering frequencies were used to define them. Thus, the 
results obtained then were compared against MDLHydroD softwares results. For comparison KCS and KVLCC2
vessels' hull structures were used. Results shows good agreement in both the software.
